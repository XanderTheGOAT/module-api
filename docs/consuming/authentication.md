## Sessions

The API will respect any session cookies which are available, i.e if the user is logged in then calls to the API will also be authenticated.



## Access Tokens

Access Tokens allow for authenticated calls to the API via request headers. Set the value of the `X-access-token` header to the token and it will be picked up by Nails and validated. Invalid or expired tokens will return a XXX or YYY response accordingly.
